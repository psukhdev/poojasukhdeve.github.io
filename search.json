    "text": "Computer Science Graduate Student · Data Analyst · Web Developer\n\n\n\nHi, I’m a passionate Computer Science graduate student at Boston University, with 5+ years of hands-on experience in software development, web development, and data analytics. I specialize in building scalable, accessible, and user-centric solutions. I’m proficient in Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, and I’m skilled at transforming complex data into actionable insights using visualization tools like Tableau and SHAP.\n\n\nMy journey includes developing accessible learning modules for visually impaired users, leading award-winning hackathon teams, and contributing to both academic research and innovative industry projects. I love collaborating across disciplines to solve real-world problems with code and data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Analytics & Visualization\n\nUnlock actionable insights from complex data.\n\nData wrangling & cleaning\nPredictive modeling\nDashboards & visualization\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware & Web Development\n\nRobust web frontend & backend solutions\n\nFull-stack dev\nResponsive UI/UX\nAPI integration\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication Development\n\nDelivering innovative and cutting-edge application development\n\nTesting & Quality Assurance\nDeployment & Maintenance\nDesign & Architecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeveraged machine learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to analyze exoplanet datasets. Achieved 75% model accuracy and used SHAP for interpretable AI, revealing the key features behind exoplanet detection.\nImpact: Balanced accuracy with interpretability to support scientific discovery.\n\n\nFigure 1: GMM Clustering of Exoplanets\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Feature Importance in Random Forest Classifier\n\n  Python    Jupyter    Pandas    scikit-learn    SHAP \n View code on GitHub  \n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data to predict disease risk and optimize health insurance strategies. Employed models like Random Forest and KNN (best accuracy: 84.3%) and used SHAP values for model transparency.\nImpact: Provided actionable health risk insights to support healthcare decision-making.\n  R   dplyr   ggplot2   caret    SHAP \n View code on GitHub \n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt a Tableau dashboard visualizing Netflix’s global content, genre trends, and maturity ratings. Highlighted U.S. dominance, movie-to-series ratio, and the evolution of content diversity since 2015.\nImpact: Enabled data-driven understanding of streaming content trends for business and consumers.\n\n\nFigure 1: Netflix Data Visualization Dashboard\n\n  Tableau    Python    Pandas \n View dashboard on GitHub  \n\n\n\nThis space-themed portfolio is more than just visuals — it’s a cosmic blueprint built with clean code, interactive UI, and modern design principles.\nInteractive: From pixel-perfect layouts to interactive TypeScript components, everything here is crafted for clarity, speed, and stellar user experience.\n\n\nFigure 1: Home interaction page\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Skills interaction page\n\n  TypeScript    React    HTML    CSS    Node.js \n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloped an interactive visualization tool to help visually impaired users understand data structures like lists and sets in Python. This tool is part of a larger inclusive Python book project.\nImpact: Advanced accessibility in programming education.\n  Python    Jupyter    Overleaf   View code on GitHub  \n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming Languages: Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS, Java, PHP\n\n\nWeb Development: Node.js, React, Angular, jQuery, Bootstrap, API Integration, Git, Responsive Design\n\n\nData Visualization & Analytics: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, NumPy, SHAP, Excel\n\n\nData Engineering & Tools: OpenCV, Spark Apache, AWS\n\n\nOther Tools: GitHub, Outlook, R Studio, Jupyter, SQLite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterested in collaborating or want to connect?
